    <h2>Anime: Boku no Hero Academia</h2>

    <p>
        Rikido Sato, also known as the Sweets Hero: Sugarman, is one of the supporting characters in My Hero Academia and he is a student in Class 1-A at U.A. High School, who is training to become a Pro Hero. 
        Rikido is a loyal and kind-hearted young boy who has an interest in sweets and baking, later being a useful skill to have due to his own Quirk.

       He is surprisingly very creative and talented at making sweets, conquering his classmates with his food. The fact that Rikido was caught someone by surprise by this overly positive reaction suggests that he himself doesn't think a lot of his own abilities as a confectioner.

       Nevertheless, every week in the dorms, Rikido bakes sweets and desserts and shares them with his classmates, which he calls “ Sugar Time.” He also likes pairing his sweets with Momo’s tea to create a nice gourmet night.
