    <h2>Anime: Akame ga Kill!</h2>

    <p>
      The Speed of Lightning: Susanoo (or just Susanoo) was one of the new members of Night Raid that Najenda brought back from the Revolutionary Army HQ. He was an adept fighter and quite resilient to damage due to his status as a humanoid Teigu. He also served as Night Raid's housekeeper and aided Akame in Night Raid's daily chores as well as training with Tatsumi. 

      Susanoo had apricot skin, blue hair and blue eyes. He was very tall and appeared to be in his early 20s. His nost notable feature were the two bison-like horns protruding out of the sides of his head. He was always seen wearing a white, red and black robe.
