<h2>Description</h2>


<p class="text">
    Nikujaga is a light Japanese beef and potato stew. Originally created by chefs from the Imperial Japanese Navy, it’s now a common weeknight dish found in households and restaurants throughout Japan.

    The staple ingredients are usually thin strips of beef alongside onion, carrot, shirataki noodles and the star of the dish – potatoes. Cooked using a drop lid known at otoshibuta, everything is cooked to perfection, maintaining shape and structure while absorbing the flavours of the stock and seasoning

<h4> Steps to Prepare your Tasty Meal</h4>

<p class="words"> 
    Remove shirataki noodles from the packet and cut roughly in half. Place in a bowl and cover with boiling water for a few minutes. Drain and set aside.

    Pour the vegetable oil in a medium saucepan over medium high heat. Add the thinly sliced beef strips and fry for a minute or two until brown. Pour in the soy sauce, sake, sugar and mirin and allow the meat to soak up the flavours for a further 1-2 minutes.

    Next, add the potatoes, carrot and onion. Mix together then pour in the drained shirataki noodles. Frying for another minute or two.

    Pour in the dashi stock and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to simmer on low medium heat.

    Scoop off any foam on top with a spoon and give everything a gentle stir, then cover with a lid or otoshibuta (Japanese drop lid – you can also use aluminium foil or paper towel). Simmer for a further 10 minutes or until the potatoes are cooked through and soft. Note: You can check potatoes with a fork or chopstick.

    Remove the lid or otoshibuta and pop your green beans on top, allowing them to cook for a minute before switching off the heat.
    
    Serve immediately, or allow to cool then pop in the fridge until you’re ready to reheat on a low simmer. This will allow the flavours to develop over time.
