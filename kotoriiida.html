    <h2>Anime: Sweetness & Lightning</h2>

    <p>
        Kotori Iida (飯田 小鳥 Iida Kotori) is a student in high school and often hangs out with Kōhei Inuzuka (the math teacher) after school. Kouhei and Kotori usually cook together alongside Tsumugi Inuzuka (Kouhei's only daughter).

        Kotori is a slim and beautiful teenage girl with waist-length jet black hair that has bangs hanging over her face and on the both sides (at school, she styles her hair in two styles; She unties her hair when she is at school, whilst she ties her hair back in a ponytail when she is in the restaurant cooking with Kōhei Inuzuka and Tsumugi Inuzuka), dark green eyes and a curvaceous body.

She also seem to have bandage on her left ring finger, probably due to cutting herself with a knife. She wears red glasses at school. At school, she wears the standard girl's uniform that consists of a white button-up shirt, a red ribbon, a burgundy skirt, knee-length socks and brown loafers.
