    <h2>Anime: One Piece</h2>

    <p>
        "Black Leg" Sanji,[12] born as Vinsmoke Sanji,[23][24][25] is the cook of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet.[5] He is the fifth member of the crew and the fourth to join, doing so at the end of the Baratie Arc.

        Born as the third son and fourth child of the Vinsmoke Family[26] (thus making him a former prince of the Germa Kingdom), he disowned his family twice, once in his youth and again after reuniting with them as an adult.[27] After fleeing the Vinsmokes as a child, he eventually entered the care of Zeff as the sous chef of the Baratie, where he would remain until he met Monkey D. Luffy, who convinced him to join his crew.
        
        His dream is to find the rumored chef's paradise, All Blue, which is where East Blue, West Blue, North Blue, and South Blue meet, along with their wildlife. He is one of the top three fighters of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Zoro.
        
        He first gained a bounty of Beli.png77,000,000 for his role in the Enies Lobby Arc, it later increased to Beli.png177,000,000 after the Dressrosa Incident. But the condition of his bounty was changed to Only Alive due to his biological father's interference. It was later reverted back to Dead or Alive after escaping from Big Mom's territory with a value of Beli.png330,000,000.[28] His current bounty is Beli.png1,032,000,000 after the events of the Raid on Onigashima. Despite renouncing his surname Vinsmoke,[24] the World Government labels it as part of his name on his wanted poster.[25]
