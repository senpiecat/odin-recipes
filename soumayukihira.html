    <h2>Anime: Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma</h2>

    <p>
        Sōma Yukihira (幸平 創真, Yukihira Sōma?) is the main protagonist of Shokugeki no Soma. He is the son of Jōichirō Yukihira and Tamako Yukihira, the proud owner of Restaurant Yukihira. He is a 92nd Tōtsuki Generation alumnus and a former resident of Polar Star Dormitory. He is also a previous 1st seat of the Elite Ten Council.

        Sōma is a young teenage boy with yellow eyes and a vertical scar on his left eyebrow. It is shown that Sōma has had this scar as far back as elementary school. He has spiky dark-red hair with short bangs. After the Stagiaire event, Soma's bangs grew in length, now reaching just below his cheeks and has more volume overall. Four months after the Régiment de Cuisine, Soma cut his hair short with a similar hairstyle from his initial appearance.

Sōma's main outfit is his Restaurant Yukihira cooking uniform, consisting of a black shirt with the restaurant's logo on the back and left chest area of his shirt. Whenever he cooks, he wears a white apron over his waist. While at Tōtsuki, Sōma wears a black coat summer school uniform over his Yukihira cooking uniform. Sōma also ties his trademark white headband around his forehead whenever he cooks. If he is not cooking or bathing, he wears his headband around his left wrist. Compared to his fellow Tōtsuki students, Sōma dresses very casually; in his free time, he sports a hanten jacket with a simple white shirt beneath it and a striped track pants at his places of residence. Sōma states that dressing in his hanten calms him down.
