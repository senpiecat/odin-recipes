    <h2>Anime: Toradora!</h2>

    <p>
        Ryuuji Takasu (高須 竜児, Takasu Ryūji) is the series' main male protagonist. He is a sixteen-year-old high school student in his second year, in class 2-C. Due to biological inheritance, his sanpaku eyes make him look like an intimidating delinquent and cause many misunderstandings. He lives in a fatherless family with just his mother and, due to this, Ryuuji has learned to be self-sufficient. He is good at cooking and keeps everything in his house clean (to the point of obsession), and also excels at sewing. 

        Ryuuji is a young man of average height with short, blue hair, and due to heredity, his sanpaku eyes make him look like an intimidating delinquent and causes many misunderstandings[1] because people find him scary. He is usually seen wearing the school uniform.
