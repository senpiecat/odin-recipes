    <h2>Anime: Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma</h2>

    <p>
        Jōichirō Yukihira (幸平 城一郎, Yukihira Jōichirō?), né Saiba (才波, Saiba?), is the widowed father of Sōma Yukihira. He was a 69th Tōtsuki Generation student, a former resident of the Polar Star Dormitory, and previously started out as a 7th seat of the Elite Ten Council as a freshman before being promoted to 2nd seat during his third year. Due to pressure received by his peers to keep being the best in Tōtsuki, he subsequently left the Academy by the suggestion of Senzaemon Nakiri. He never returned, causing him to not graduate. Nonetheless, he is a prodigious chef who is looked up to by all. 

        Jōichirō has long, brown hair which is swept back, save for a single group of bangs that hangs over his face down to his chin. Even when cooking, all of his hair is tied back except for that one strand. His eyes are sharper and more serious than his son and he has a slight beard on his chin. His body is well toned and generally, wears form fitting shirts and pants. His outfits when shown are usually his standard Yukihira cooking uniform or a professional white chef's uniform when cooking in New York. Upon his return to Polar Star Dormitory, he wore a tight black shirt and slacks.

In his youth, Jōichirō's overall appearance resembles Sōma's current appearance. His hair was just as unkempt, but missing his signature long bang and much shorter. His eyes were much more relaxed and carefree. Unlike Gin, Jōichirō's coat was unbuttoned, his tie was rarely tied up to his neck, his dress shirt was open and his undershirt was visible.
