    <h2>Anime: Black Clover</h2>

    <p>
        Charmy Pappitson 「チャーミー・パピットソン Chāmī Papittoson」 is a dwarf-human hybrid[3] and a 1st Class Junior Magic Knight of the Clover Kingdom's Black Bull squad.

        Charmy is a petite girl with shoulder-length black hair and green eyes, appearing much younger than her age with some confusing her for a small child. One of her facial features is her thin eyebrows and wide forehead. She usually sports her hair in an upside-down bun hairstyle with fringes framing both sides of her face, and her forehead left exposed.

Her attire consists of only a light-colored white tunic and dark-colored pants. Her tunic extends below her waist and has long sleeves that reach slightly past her elbows. Additionally, the tunic also has a kangaroo pocket at the front on her stomach area. Her pants extend slightly below her knees and fit perfectly for her. She sports a blue satchel that she slings over her right shoulder, which carries her grimoire on her left side. Finally, she also wears a pair of light-colored yellow flats for her footwear.

As a member of the Black Bull squad, Charmy also wears the squad's signature robe. It is a short, black robe that only covers the upper half of her torso. It has gold trimmings and a hood. The squad's insignia is positioned on the left-hand side while a gold button that keeps the robe together is located on the opposite side. She is often seen with blushed cheeks.

At the beach, Charmy wears a blue and white-striped, one-piece bathing suit.[6]

When she activates her Food Magic, Charmy grows much taller and obtains a much more mature look and developed body, making her look more her age. In this form, her hair hangs loose
