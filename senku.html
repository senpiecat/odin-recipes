    <h2>Anime: Dr.Stone</h2>

    <p>
        Senku Ishigami (石神千空 Ishigami Senkū) is the main protagonist of Dr. Stone, and is friends with Taiju Oki and Yuzuriha Ogawa. He is known for his catchphrases, one of which is "Ten Billion Percent".[13] He was de-petrified half a year before Taiju was, and eventually created the Revival Fluid with Taiju's help.[14] In the Stone World, Senku wants to rebuild civilization and establish a Kingdom of Science.

        As the first-prize champion in the Grand Bout, Senku currently holds the title of Village Chief in Ishigami Village, where he is widely regarded as a legend thanks to the late Byakuya’s influence in the founding of Ishigami Village.
        
        Senku is the de facto leader of the Kingdom of Science. Later, as a member of the Five Wise Commanders, Senku provides the ideas and initiative for their large scale plans; he consults with Chrome, Gen, Ukyo, and Ryusui before taking action.
