    <h2>Anime: Monster Musume</h2>

    <p>
      Kimihito Kurusu (来留主 公人, Kurusu Kimihito) (a.k.a. Darling, Boss[note 1], Master, Milord, Beloved[note 2], Honey, Mr. Darling, Snookums, Loverboy, Buddy or Mr. Newhire) is a “volunteer” for the Cultural Exchange Between Species Bill. He is assigned as a host to a Lamia named Miia, whom he takes care of. After spending some time together, Miia eventually falls in love with him. He is later assigned a Harpy named Papi, and then gets chosen by a Centaur named Centorea, both of whom proclaim their love for him. Later on, he gains two more girls: a Slime whom Papi names Suu, and the Mermaid Meroune Lorelei. He later takes in an Arachne, Rachnera Arachnera, who also takes an interest in him. Later still, he gains the affections of a Dullahan named Lala, who also moves in. He is the main protagonist of the series. 

      Kimihito is a tall young man with messy black hair. His eyes are typically shown as empty white circles. When he’s serious, or when he is being particularly romantic, it is shown that he has brown irises. He has light skin, which is often covered in scrapes, bruises, or bandages from how often he is injured by his homestays’ advances, and typically wears graphic T-shirts.

Centorea’s mother summarizes Kimihito’s appearance as being “unremarkably average”.
