    <h2>Description</h2>


    <p class="text">
      Japanese strawberry shortcake is a popular cake in Japan made with soft, fluffy sponge cake, decorated with fresh whipped cream, and fresh strawberries.

      In fact this strawberry cream cake is popular in a lot of Asian countries and goes by many names, including Korean strawberry cake, fresh cream cake, and Chinese strawberry cake.
      
      What they all have in common is the strawberry sponge cake is not overly sweet and is filled with fresh fruit. Asian sponge cakes are usually frosted with fresh whipped cream instead of buttercream.

    <h4> Steps to Prepare your Tasty Strawberry Shortcake</h4>
    
    <p class="words"> 
     <b>Step 1</b> Bake the sponge cake

     and let it cool completely or overnight in the chiller. Do not fill or frost the cake while warm, as the cream may melt. Slice into 3 horizontal layers.
    </p>

     <p class="words"> 
      <b>Step 2</b> Whip up the cream

      Combine whipping cream, icing sugar, and vanilla extract in a mixing bowl. Whip until stiff peaks. Set the whipped cream in the chiller until needed. 
    </p>

      <p class="words"> 
        <b>Step 3</b> Prepare the syrup

      Dissolve 1 tablespoon of sugar in 2 tablespoons of boiling water and let the syrup cool
    </p>

      <p class="words"> 
        <b>Step 4</b> Slice the strawberries

      Choose the best-looking ones for the cake topping. For the filling, cut a few strawberries into halves or slices.
    </p>

      <p class="words"> 
        <b>Step 5</b> The fun part – assembly

      Bottom layer. Brush syrup on the first sponge layer with a clean pastry brush. Then spread a thick layer of whipped cream with an offset spatula.
      Middle layer: Align the second layer and brush with syrup again. Cover with whipped cream. Place the sliced strawberries on top. Leave half-inch (1-cm) of the edge and the center free so you get neat edges when you slice the cake. Spread more whipped cream to cover the strawberries.

      Top layer: Place the last sponge cake layer on top and brush with syrup. Crumb-coat the top and sides of the cake, including all the empty pockets in between the layers. Scrape off the excess cream with the offset spatula. Then chill the cake for 15 minutes.

      Final coat: Cover the top and sides of the cake with a thick layer of whipped cream – leaving enough for the piped decorations. Smoothen with a cake scraper or offset spatula.
      Decorating: Fit a piping bag with a piping tip and fill with the remaining whipped cream. Pipe the patterns. Decorate with whole and cut strawberries, as desired. Sift icing sugar over the fruit, or brush with a glaze.

   <b>Step 6</b> Chilling
  
  Lastly, chill the assembled cake overnight in the refrigerator to firm up the cream.
  
  It will taste even more amazing. Overnight chilling allows the flavors of the cake to come together beautifully.
  
  The sponge layers will absorb the syrup, turning extra moist, and the strawberries will soften and taste sweeter.

  How to store Japanese strawberry shortcake
  
  A filled and frosted strawberry shortcake keeps well in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. To enjoy it at its freshest, consume within the first 3 days.
  
  If you plan to make this ahead, I recommend baking the sponge cake and freezing it.
  
  Thaw the frozen sponge cake overnight in the chiller the day before you plan to fill and frost. Let the finished cake chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight, to firm up the cream.

  <h4>For the sponge cake</h4>For the sponge cake
  
      1 round 6/7-inch (15/18-cm)
      12 fresh strawberries
  
     <h4>For the Chantilly cream</h4>
  
      875 g whipping cream 35 – 38% butterfat
      60 g confectioner's sugar
      2 tsp vanilla extract
  
  <h4>For the syrup</h4>
  
      12 g sugar
      30 g hot water
  
  <h4>Instructions</h4>
   
    <p class="words"></p>
      <b>Make the sponge cake:</b> Bake the sponge cake and let it cool completely before using, or preferably overnight in the chiller (recommended). Slice the cake into 3 layers of equal height. Tip: For a professional bakery look, slice the brown crust off the top of the cake.
    </p>

      <p class="words">
      <b>Make the Chantilly cream:</b> Chill the stand mixer bowl and whisk attachment. Start with cold whipping cream in the bowl, and add the confectioner's sugar and vanilla extract.
      Whip on medium speed until soft peaks start to form – this is when you start to see the whisk form trail lines in the cream. Watch carefully as you whip, and stop as soon as you see stiff peaks. Keep the whipped cream in the chiller until needed.
    </p>

      <p class="words">
      <b>Prepare the strawberries:</b> Choose the best-looking ones for the cake topping. For the filling between the cake layers, cut a few strawberries into halves or slices, as desired.
      Make the syrup: Dissolve 1 tbsp sugar in 2 tbsps boiling water. Cool before using.
  </p>

 <h4>Assemble the cake</h4> 
  
 <p class="words">
      <b>Bottom layer:</b> With a clean pastry brush, brush syrup on the sponge layer. Using an offset spatula, spread a generous layer of whipped cream on top.
    </p>

      <p class="words">
      <b>Middle layer:</b> Place another sponge layer neatly on top. Brush with syrup and spread whipped cream in an even layer. Place the strawberry halves or slices, leaving 0.5-inch (1-cm) of the edge free. Keep the centre free as well so you can get neat edges when you cut the cake. Spread whipped cream on top until it covers the top of the strawberries.
    </p>

      <p class="words">
        <b>Top layer:</b> Place the last sponge cake layer neatly on top and brush with syrup. Fill the sides of the cake, making sure you get cream into the pockets in between the layers. Crumb-coat the top and sides with a thin layer of whipped cream. Scrape off the excess cream with the offset spatula. Chill the cake for 15 minutes.
    </p>

      <p class="words">

      Decorate: Fit a piping bag with your choice of piping tip and fill with the remaining whipped cream. Pipe the patterns. Decorate with whole and cut strawberries, as desired. Brush with neutral gel or glaze, or sift some confectioner's sugar over the fruit. 
    </p>

      <p class="words">

        <b>Chill:</b> Chill the assembled cake for at least 4 hours, or overnight in the refrigerator to firm up the cream. Tip: Overnight chilling allows the flavours of the cake to meld together beautifully! Best eaten within 3 days once filled and frosted.
